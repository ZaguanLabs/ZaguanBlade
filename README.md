# Zaguán Blade

**The AI-Native Code Editor.**

Zaguán Blade (`zblade`) is a high-performance, AI-first code editor built for the future of development. It serves as the graphical interface (the "Body") that connects to the Zaguán AI system (the "Brain").

> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha Release (v0.0.4-alpha)**
> This is an early Alpha release. It is functional and "good enough" for daily use, but please expect bugs and incomplete features.
> *   Current Limitation: **Diff views are currently non-functional.**
> *   Stability: Experimental but usable.

## Requirement: Zaguán AI Subscription

Zaguán Blade is powered by our hosted AI backend. To use the AI features (Chat, Code Generation, Auto-fix), you **must have an active subscription**.

👉 **[Get a Subscription at ZaguanAI.com](https://zaguanai.com/pricing)**

Without a subscription and a valid API Key, Zaguán Blade functions as a standard (albeit very nice) text editor.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Native Workflow**: Deeply integrated AI that understands your project context.
*   **Performance**: Built with **Rust** (Tauri v2) and **React**, offering near-native performance with the flexibility of web technologies.
*   **Blade Protocol**: Utilizes our custom BP (Blade Protocol) for high-fidelity communication between the editor and the AI. *Note: The Blade Protocol specification is currently internal.*

## Installation

We provide pre-built binaries for Windows (`.msi`, `.exe`), macOS (`.dmg`, `.app`), and Linux (`.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`).
