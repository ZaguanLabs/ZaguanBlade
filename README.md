# Zaguán Blade

**The AI-Native Code Editor Built on Rust.**

Zaguán Blade is a high-performance AI code editor that takes a fundamentally different approach from VSCode forks. While others bolt AI onto existing editors, we built from the ground up with AI as the foundation—and Rust as the engine.

---

## Why build another AI editor?

Zaguán Blade isn't just another AI editor. It's a combination of a code editor and an AI system backend. Together they create a whole and I had two goals in mind when I started this project:

1. **AI-Native Workflow**: Deeply integrated AI that understands your project context.
2. **Save Money**: Vibe Coding sends a lot of data to the providers and they charge a lot for it. The server I created does its best to send only what is relevant while also making sure that the model has enough context to understand your project.

These 2 systems work together to create a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. I spent a lot of time getting the server to work well and borrowed a lot of knowledge from many other open source projects like Cline, Roo-Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini-CLI, Qwen-Code, and many others.

### Active Development

Zaguán Blade is currently in active development. We are working on many new features and improvements and things may be unstable at times while I update the server. I will try my very best to keep the updates regular and give a heads up, but that's not a guarantee during this phase of development.

There are many things that I've planned for both Zaguán Blade and the server too numerous to list here.

The server and the system prompts are relatively opinionated tailored to my preferences and the way I like to work.

I'm also planning on updating the GUI that emphasizes more the AI-first approach and workflow. I was mostly inspired by the many VSCode forks out there like Windsurf, Cursor et al during the initial development just to get something working.

## What Makes Zaguán Blade Different?

### 1. **Rust-First Architecture**

Unlike VSCode forks (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) that run heavy processing in JavaScript, Zaguán Blade does **everything performance-critical in Rust**:

- **Tree-sitter parsing**: Native Rust, not WASM → **10x faster** (5ms vs 50ms)
- **Symbol indexing**: SQLite in Rust with full-text search → **10x faster**
- **File operations**: Native async I/O with Tokio → **No main thread blocking**
- **Context assembly**: Parallel processing in Rust → **10x faster** than JS

**Result:** 5x less memory usage, 10x faster operations, smoother UI.

### 2. **"File on Disk is Truth" Paradigm**

Most AI editors maintain complex virtual buffers and preview states. Zaguán Blade is simpler:

- AI writes changes **directly to disk** (with history snapshots)
- File watcher triggers automatic reload
- Accept = Keep the change (already on disk)
- Reject = Revert from history snapshot

**Why this matters:** No state synchronization bugs, no "preview vs actual" confusion, instant feedback.

### 3. **Dual Protocol Architecture**

Zaguán Blade uses two distinct protocols:

**Blade Protocol** - Communication between Blade and zcoderd (AI backend):
- WebSocket-based streaming
- Handles AI chat, tool execution, context assembly
- Server-side code analysis and validation

**BCP (Blade Change Protocol)** - Internal IPC within Blade:
- **Versioned & extensible**: Semantic versioning with compatibility checks
- **Domain-based**: Chat, Editor, File, Workflow, Terminal, History, System
- **Intent/Event model**: Clear causality tracking with UUIDs
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate operations on retry
- Unified dispatcher pattern with single `dispatch()` command

**Not just JSON-RPC.** Purpose-built for AI-native workflows.

### 4. **Intelligent Context Assembly**

The backend intelligently assembles code context:

- **Symbol-based selection**: Includes related definitions, usages, types
- **Token budget management**: Fits within model context limits
- **Semantic relationships**: Uses tree-sitter for smart extraction
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple files processed concurrently

**Result:** AI gets exactly what it needs, nothing more. Lower costs, better results.

### 5. **Agentic Loop with Guardrails**

Built-in protection against common AI failure modes:

- **Loop detection**: Prevents repetitive tool calls
- **Stagnation detection**: Stops when AI makes no progress
- **Tool spam prevention**: Limits identical operations
- **Parallel read optimization**: Multiple file reads execute concurrently

**Why this matters:** Saves tokens, prevents runaway costs, faster execution.

### 6. **History & Uncommitted Changes System**

Every AI change is tracked:

- **Automatic snapshots** before any modification
- **Uncommitted changes panel** shows all pending changes
- **Per-file accept/reject** with diff preview
- **Batch operations**: Accept all / Reject all
- **Full undo history** with group operations

**Currently working:** Changes apply immediately, tracking system operational.

### 7. **Native Performance**

Built with Tauri v2 (not Electron):

- **Compact bundles**: 12MB (.deb/.rpm), 95MB (AppImage with runtime)
- **Lower memory**: 50-100MB vs 200-500MB for Electron apps
- **Native speed**: Rust backend, no VM overhead
- **Better startup**: <100ms to first interaction
- **Efficient**: No Chromium overhead, uses system WebView
