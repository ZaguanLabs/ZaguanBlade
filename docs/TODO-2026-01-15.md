- [x] Create a per-project state save file on disk. This state file is based on the current project directory and must include the current state of zblade: Active file open, open files/tabs, selected AI model, active/open terminals. Load the state file when opening a project. Save the state file when closing a project. This implementation should be OS agnostic and use the most common file storage patterns. On Linux, that I use, use the XDG standard for configuration files in `~/.config/zaguanblade/`. On MacOS and Windows, use the standard configuration directory for the respective OS.
- [x] There is a lot more work to be done in the AI Chat interface. I need the font to be smaller, the pane must be resizable, Reasoning **must** be properly formatted in a way that shows the reasoning process and in a non-intrusive manner. The tool command cards must be less prominent and not distract from the main chat interface and doesn't need to show every single detail of the command in question unless it's a `run_command` tool call in which case it should show the command and the output. For a `run_command` call, I want a "Copy" icon that I can click to copy the command. This is standard in many editors I've used.
- [x] In the editor, I want file icons for the most used file formats shown in the tabs. Go, Rust, Markdown, Text, .gitignore, JSON, YAML, TOML, JS, TS, HTML, CSS, and more.
- [x] We also have to implement a Right click menu for the Terminal. I want to be able to copy, paste, and clear the terminal in addition to "Send to chat" if I select text.
- [x] Our F11 implementation need some tweaking. When used, the top bar shoul be visible because it will be used a lot more going forward. In full screen mode, we can (if possible) remove the 3 resize/close action buttons so that the full immersion mode feels complete.
- [x] Begin working on implementing a File menu. This means that the text "Zaguán Blade" that is currently on the left side of the top bar should be centered to leave space for a File menu on the left side.
- [ ] Here is probably the biggest task. I have a vague idea of making the Chat Input area into a kind of Command Center. This means that it'll become a lot more sophisticated and will also take up a little more space. This task has low priority because I have to use zblade more until I have a much clearer vision.
